# Perceptron-Classifier

I wrote two perceptron classifiers (vanilla and averaged) to identify hotel reviews as either true or fake, and either positive or negative using word tokens as features.

### Unknown Tokens: 
```
The classifier will simply ignore unknown tokens in the test data.

```

### Tokenization: 

```
Mapped punctuations to space and lowercased all the letters.
Ignored stop words.
```

### Running the Model
```
Compare the output generated by my model ('percepoutput.txt') with 'tagged_devdata.txt' from the data folder.

```
